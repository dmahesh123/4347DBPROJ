Description and Motivation of EcoCraft:
	The main motivation behind our project is to reduce waste in a fun and creative way by using a database of creative arts and crafts projects, mainly using recycled materials
In today’s world, sustainability is a growing concern and waste management is a critical issue. This project can take small actions, like turning discarded items into art, which in turn can make a significant impact over time, especially for the younger generation. By fostering creativity and encouraging the use of recycled materials, we aim to promote environmental consciousness in an engaging and educational way. We expect that the database design can be used in places such as schools or at home where children can create craft ideas with materials that already exist. Teachers and parents can integrate these projects and teach students the importance of upcycling and reusing materials. This can additionally be used in community centers, summer camps, and anywhere where children can unleash their potential. The system can also serve as a useful tool for environmental organizations or workshops focused on sustainability to enable creative ways of reducing waste.
